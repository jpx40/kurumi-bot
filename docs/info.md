## technical details about this project

This project was entirely built in Rust using the [poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise) library and some discord api calls are being fetched by using [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest). The [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) wrapper is being used for databases in combination with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). Without these amazing libraries this project wouldnt be possible, their work shall be appreciated!
