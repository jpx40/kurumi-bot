![Build](https://github.com/Asm-Rosie/adhd-helper-bot/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

## How to run
## First get ur discord bot token

once you have it create in ur project root dir a file called "Secrets.toml" you place this in there 
```toml
DISCORD_TOKEN="replace with ur token"
APP_ID="your app id"
GITHUB_REPO="your github repo (e.g. Asm-Rosie/kurumi-bot)
GITHUB_TOKEN="your github token"
LOG_CHANNEL="channel id"
BOT_ID = "bot user id here"
DB_PW = "your database password"
DB_NAME = "your database name"
```

now make a .env, and in there store your database url just like this
```.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password123@localhost:5432/discord_bot
```

make sure you have [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed for your OS and set up.

after you have ensured that all these values are set start the discord bot with `cargo run`
